11. What is Reflection API:

 The Reflection API in Java allows you to inspect, analyze, and manipulate classes, methods, fields, and constructors at runtime,
 even if you don't know their names at compile time.

 12. What is ?

    Class<T> is a generic class that represents a class or interface at runtime.
    ? means "any type" (unknown generic type).
    This allows clazz to hold a Class reference for any type, without knowing the exact type at compile-time.

  13. How to Prevent Reflection from Breaking Singleton

      We can throw an exception inside the constructor if it is already initialized.
      private Singleton() {
              if (instance != null) {
                  throw new RuntimeException("Use getInstance() to create an object");
              }
          }
