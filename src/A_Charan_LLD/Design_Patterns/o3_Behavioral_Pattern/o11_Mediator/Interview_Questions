1. Introduction to Mediator Pattern

The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that reduces direct dependencies between multiple objects by introducing a
mediator object that facilitates communication between them. Instead of objects communicating directly, they communicate via a
central mediator.

Q2. What problem does the Mediator Pattern solve?

It reduces tight coupling between objects by introducing a central mediator that manages their interactions.

Q3. What are the key components of the Mediator Pattern?

Mediator Interface → Defines communication methods.
Concrete Mediator → Implements communication logic.
Colleague Interface → Represents objects that communicate via the mediator.
Concrete Colleague → Objects that send and receive messages.

Q5. Can the Mediator Pattern introduce performance issues?

Yes, if too much logic is moved into the mediator, it can become a bottleneck and increase complexity.
