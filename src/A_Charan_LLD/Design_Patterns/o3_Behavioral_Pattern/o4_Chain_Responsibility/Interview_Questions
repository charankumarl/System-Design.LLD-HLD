1. What is the Chain of Responsibility pattern?

The Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that allows multiple handlers to process a request sequentially.
If one handler cannot process the request, it passes it to the next handler in the chain. This pattern helps decouple senders and receivers.

Allows multiple object to handlers a request without sender needing to know which object will ultimately process it.

2. What are the key components of the Chain of Responsibility pattern?

Handler (Abstract Class or Interface) â€“ Defines an interface for handling requests and stores a reference to the next handler.

Concrete Handlers (Subclasses) â€“ Implement request handling logic and decide whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler.

Client â€“ Creates the chain and initiates request processing.

3. What problem does the Chain of Responsibility pattern solve?

It avoids tight coupling between the sender and the receiver by allowing multiple objects to process a request.
 It also eliminates long if-else or switch statements, making the system more modular and flexible.

 9. Can Chain of Responsibility be implemented using Java's built-in features?

 Yes! Java's javax.servlet.FilterChain and java.util.logging.Logger use the Chain of Responsibility pattern.

 Example:

 In Servlet Filters, each filter processes the request and can either modify it or pass it to the next filter.
 In Logging Frameworks, log messages pass through different handlers (console, file, email).

13. How can you make the Chain of Responsibility pattern more efficient?

âœ… Use short-circuiting â€“ If a handler processes the request, stop passing it to the next handler.
âœ… Implement lazy evaluation â€“ Create handlers only when they are needed.
âœ… Use caching â€“ If handlers perform expensive computations, store results for reuse

15. What are some real-life use cases of the Chain of Responsibility pattern?

ðŸ“Œ Logging Frameworks (Log4j, SLF4J) â€“ Logs are passed through different handlers.
ðŸ“Œ Servlet Filters â€“ Filters process HTTP requests sequentially.
ðŸ“Œ ATM Withdrawal â€“ ATM processes money withdrawals using different denominations.
ðŸ“Œ Event Handling in UI â€“ Mouse and keyboard events pass through UI elements.
ðŸ“Œ Middleware in Web Frameworks â€“ Requests pass through multiple middlewares.
