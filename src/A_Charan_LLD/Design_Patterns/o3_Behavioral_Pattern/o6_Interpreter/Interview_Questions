1. What is the Interpreter Pattern?

It is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to evaluate expressions in a language by defining a grammar.
Based on Context the interpret will happen.

-> Defines a way grammer to evaluate the expression.

2️⃣ What are the key components of the Interpreter Pattern?

✅ Abstract Expression, Terminal Expression, Non-Terminal Expression, Context, and Client.

3️⃣ Where is the Interpreter Pattern used in real life?

✅ SQL Parsers, Regular Expressions, Rule-Based Systems, Compilers.

5️⃣ Why is the Interpreter Pattern not recommended for complex grammars?

✅ Because it increases code complexity and reduces performance due to recursive parsing.

6️⃣ How can we optimize the Interpreter Pattern?

✅ By using Memoization, Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), or pre-compiling expressions.
