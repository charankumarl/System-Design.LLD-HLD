    1. What is Visitor Pattern.

    Allows us to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying the structures.

    Achieved this by seperating operators / methods, from Class / Object.

    We can also achieve the Double Dispatch.

2. What all are required, to achieve Visitor Pattern.

    Make a Room Class as IRoomElement.  Create a Concrete class for Room if required.

    Create a Visitor Interface.  Create a Concrete class for Visitor, for all the Methods / Operations.

    IRoomElement                                            IVisitor
    SingleRoom   DoubleRoom                           price     available   maintenance   etc...

3. What is Single Dispatch and Double Dispatch.

    Single Dispatch -  Method is created, with reference of only 1 object type.

        ex:  singleRoom = new SingleRoom().     singleRoom.price();    singleRoom = Single method reference

    Double Dispatch -  Method will be invoked by one Object and Another Object is passed as parameter.

        ex:  singleRoom = new SingleRoom().     singleRoom.accept(visitor);    singleRoom = Single method reference
        visitor = new Visitor().             visitor = 2nd method reference  passed as parameter.
