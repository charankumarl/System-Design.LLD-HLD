1. What is the Visitor Pattern?

The Visitor Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows adding new operations to a class structure without modifying the existing classes.
Instead, we define new operations in a separate Visitor class.

When discount changes everytime, Book or Electronoics class should not be modified.

2. What problem does the Visitor Pattern solve?

The Visitor Pattern is useful when we need to add operations to existing classes without modifying them.
This avoids modifying existing code whenever a new operation is required.

Summary

Visitor Pattern allows adding new operations without modifying existing classes.
We use accept() method in elements to pass visitors.
The visitor contains operations for each concrete element type.
Example: Shopping Cart with Book and Electronics, applying discounts and tax calculations.
