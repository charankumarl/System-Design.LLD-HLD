    /*
        For each field we need to create a constructor. So if we have 10 fields, then we need to create 10! constructors.

        This is not a right approch, which will take more time and more memory.

        To avoid this we use Builder Design Pattern.

         Drawback â†’ Too many overloaded constructors make the code hard to maintain.
